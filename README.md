### 👨‍💻 Web Development Enthusiast Since the Early 2000s

I wrote my first line of code in PHP back in **1999**, and I've been hooked ever since! 

Over the years, I've honed my skills as a **full-stack developer**, specializing in:

- 🖥️ **Backend**: PHP with **Symfony** & **API-Platform**, leveraging the power of **ReactPHP** for asynchronous event-driven applications and **Caddy** for efficient web server management.
- 🌐 **Frontend**: **VueJS** & **Nuxt**, using the awesome **TailwindCSS** for styling
- ⚡ **Real-Time Updates**: Powered by **Mercure**
- 📱 **Hybrid Apps**: Built with **Capacitor**

I love data! I like to play with databases, primarily **MySQL**, but I've had fun with **MariaDb Columnstore** (BI & Analytics), **Singlestore**,  **Solr** and **ElasticSearch**. 

Recently, I've become a huge fan and evangelist of **Meilisearch**.

### ☁️ Infrastructure & CI/CD

For hosting, I’m all about **DigitalOcean**️ and keeping things speedy with **Cloudflare**. 

Automation is key, and I use **GitHub Actions** to keep my CI/CD pipelines smooth and efficient.

### 🤖 Into Generative AI

I'm passionate about **Generative AI** and love exploring APIs from **Claude**, **Mistral**, and **OpenAI**.
